# Find your home app
System that will help to find the best location to live in a city. Eventually, the plan is to implement a web app that provides a quick evaluation and comparison between different neighbourhoods of London in terms of life quality and affordability. 

At the moment, I am implementing the evaluation of crime statistics (see `London-crime-clean-data.ipynb`).

More updates to follow...
